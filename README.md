# I developed a Tree Disease Detection Flutter app capable of identifying common tree diseases such as Gall midge, healthy and sooty mold. The app functions by allowing users to capture images from the camera or pick images from the gallery, after which it employs image recognition techniques to detect and classify diseases.
